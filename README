Gentrification Risk Forecasting Heat Map

This individual project forecasts and maps gentrification risk in Indianapolis at the neighborhood level using public data.

This model does not predict gentrification outright, but forecasts trends in key risk factors to identify neighborhoods at elevated risk based on historical patterns.

This project was independently created by Thomas Flaim, a student at Purdue University, for the purpose of demonstrating applied actuarial and real estate analytics. All modeling, data wrangling, and forecasting logic were developed from scratch unless otherwise cited.

All steps taken are dated in the journal (first sheet in the excel book)


Goals
- Predict which areas are likely to gentrify, stabilize, or decline for real estate team or urban planners.
- Showcase forecasting, modeling, and geospatial analysis skills
- Apply actuarial and statistical thinking to real estate and urban risk

Tools
- R, Excel, GitHub
- Packages: `tidycensus`, `dplyr`, etc. (many used, all listed in scripts folder)

Sources
- U.S. Census (via `tidycensus`)
- Zillow (ZHVI/ZORI)
- OpenIndy (Mayor's Action Center)
- Others isted in factor assesment document
